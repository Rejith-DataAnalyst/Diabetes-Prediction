# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict the onset of diabetes in patients based on diagnostic measurements.

## 🔍 Project Goals

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Clean the dataset and handle outliers
* Compare different ML models
* Identify the best model (KNN)
* Save the model for reuse

## 📈 Dataset

* Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
* 768 records with 8 features and 1 target variable (Outcome)

## ✅ Best Model

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* Accuracy: \~\[INSERT YOUR SCORE]% on test data

## 📆 Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📋 How to Use

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
# Step 2: Run diabetes_prediction.ipynb
# Step 3: Use the model or modify it for deployment
```

## 📄 Files Included

* `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Full analysis and model building
* `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used
* `knn_diabetes_model.pkl`: Saved model

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Improve feature engineering
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Streamlit or Flask-based web app deployment
